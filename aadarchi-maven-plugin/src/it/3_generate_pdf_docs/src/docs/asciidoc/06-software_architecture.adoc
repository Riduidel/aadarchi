The software architecture section is your "big picture" view and allows
you to present the structure of the software. Traditional software
architecture documents typically refer to this as a "conceptual view" or
"logical view", and there is often confusion about whether such views
should refer to implementation details such as technology choices.

== Intent

The purpose of this section is to summarise the software architecture of
your software system so that the following questions can be answered:

* What does the "big picture" look like?
* Is there are clear structure?
* Is it clear how the system works from the "30,000 foot view"?
* Does it show the major containers and technology choices?
* Does it show the major components and their interactions?
* What are the key internal interfaces? (e.g. a web service between your
web and business tiers)

== Structure

The link:/help/static-diagrams[container and component diagrams]
diagrams are the main focus for this section, accompanied by a short
narrative explaining what the diagram is showing plus a summary of each
container/component.

Sometimes UML sequence or collaboration diagrams showing component
interactions can be a useful way to illustrate how the software
satisfies the major use cases/user stories/etc. Only do this if it adds
value though and resist the temptation to describe how every use
case/user story works.

== Motivation

The motivation for writing this section is that it provides the "maps"
that people can use to get an overview of the software and help
developers navigate the codebase.

== Audience

The audience for this section is predominantly the technical people in
the software development team.

== Required

Yes, all technical software documentation should include a software
architecture section because it's essential that the overall software
structure is well understood by everybody on the development team.
