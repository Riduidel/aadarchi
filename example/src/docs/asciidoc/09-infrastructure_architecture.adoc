= Infrastructure Architecture
:chapter: Infrastructure%20Architecture

**TODO**
////
While most of the documentation is focused on the software itself, we do
also need to consider the infrastructure because software architecture
is about software _and_ infrastructure.

== Intent

This section is used to describe the physical/virtual hardware and
networks on which the software will be deployed. Although, as a software
architect, you may not be involved in designing the infrastructure, you
do need to understand that it's sufficient to enable you to satisfy your
goals. The purpose of this section is to answer the following types of
questions:

* Is there a clear physical architecture?
* What hardware (virtual or physical) does this include across all
tiers?
* Does it cater for redundancy, failover and disaster recovery if
applicable?
* Is it clear how the chosen hardware components have been sized and
selected?
* If multiple servers and sites are used, what are the network links
between them?
* Who is responsible for support and maintenance of the infrastructure?
* Are there central teams to look after common infrastructure (e.g.
databases, message buses, application servers, networks, routers,
switches, load balancers, reverse proxies, internet connections, etc)?
* Who owns the resources?
* Are there sufficient environments for development, testing,
acceptance, pre-production, production, etc?

== Structure

The main focus for this section is usually an infrastructure/network
diagram showing the various hardware/network components (servers,
routers, firewalls, load balancers, etc) and how they fit together, with
a short narrative to accompany the diagram.

== Motivation

The motivation for writing this section is to document the
infrastructure and confirm that it supports the software architecture.

== Audience

The audience for this section is predominantly the technical people in
the software development team along with others that may help deploy,
support and operate the software system.

== Required

Yes, an infrastructure architecture section should be included in
technical software documentation because it illustrates that the
infrastructure is understood and has been considered.
