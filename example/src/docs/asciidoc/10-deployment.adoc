**TODO**
////
The deployment section is simply the mapping between the
link:/help/documentation/software-architecture[software architecture]
and the
link:/help/documentation/infrastructure-architecture[infrastructure
architecture].

== Intent

This section is used to describe the mapping between the software (e.g.
containers) and the infrastructure. Sometimes this will be a simple
one-to-one mapping (e.g. deploy a web application to a single web
server) and at other times it will be more complex (e.g. deploy a web
application across a number of servers in a server farm). This section
answers the following types of questions:

* How and where is the software installed and configured?
* Is it clear how the software will be deployed across the
infrastructure elements described in the
link:/help/documentation/infrastructure-architecture[infrastructure
architecture section]? (e.g. one-to-one mapping, multiple containers per
server, etc)
* If this is still to be decided, what are the options and have they
been documented?
* Is it understood how memory and CPU will be partitioned between the
processes running on a single piece of infrastructure?
* Are any containers and/or components running in an active-active,
active-passive, hot-standby, cold-standby, etc formation?
* Has the deployment and rollback strategy been defined?
* What happens in the event of a software or infrastructure failure?
* Is it clear how data is replicated across sites?

== Structure

There are a few ways to structure this section:

. Tables: simple textual tables that show the mapping between software
containers and/or components with the infrastructure they will be
deployed on.
. Diagrams: UML deployment diagrams or modified versions of the diagrams
from the
link:/help/documentation/infrastructure-architecture[infrastructure
architecture section] showing where software will be running.

You can additionally use notation, colour coding, etc to the designate
the runtime status of software and infrastructure (e.g. active, passive,
hot-standby, warm-standby, cold-standby, etc).

== Motivation

The motivation for writing this section is to ensure that everybody
understands how the software is going to work once it gets out of the
development environment and also to document the often complex
deployment of enterprise software systems.

This section can provide a useful overview, even for those teams that
have adopted https://continuousdelivery.com[continuous delivery] and
have all of their deployment scripted using tools such as Puppet, Chef,
Vagrant, Docker, etc.

== Audience

The audience for this section is predominantly the technical people in
the software development team along with others that may help deploy,
support and operate the software system.

== Required

Yes, a deployment section should be included in all technical software
documentation because it can help to solve the often mysterious question
of where the software will be, or has been, deployed.
