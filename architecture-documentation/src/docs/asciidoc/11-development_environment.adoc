The development environment section allows you to summarise how people
new to your team install tools and setup a development environment in
order to work on the software.

== Intent

The purpose of this section is to provide instructions that take
somebody from a blank operating system installation to a fully-fledged
development environment.

== Structure

The type of things you might want to include are:

Pre-requisite versions of software needed::

Environment variables, Windows registry settings, etc::
TODO
Host name entries::

If you're using automated solutions (such as Vagrant, Docker, Puppet,
Chef, Rundeck, etc), it's still worth including some brief information
about how these solutions work, where to find the scripts and how to run
them.

== Motivation

The motivation for this section is to ensure that new developers can be
productive as quickly as possible.

== Audience

The audience for this section is the technical people in the software
development team, especially those who are new to the team.

== Required

Yes, because this information is usually lost and it's essential if the
software will be maintained by a different set of people from the
original developers.
