**TODO**
////
The operations and support section allows you to describe how people
will run, monitor and manage your software.

== Intent

Most systems will be subject to support and operational requirements,
particularly around how they are monitored, managed and administered.
Including a dedicated section in the software guidebook lets you be
explicit about how your software will or does support those
requirements. This section should address the following types of
questions:

* Is it clear how the software provides the ability for
operation/support teams to monitor and manage the system?
* How is this achieved across all tiers of the architecture?
* How can operational staff diagnose problems?
* Where are errors and information logged? (e.g. log files, Windows
Event Log, SMNP, JMX, WMI, custom diagnostics, etc)
* Do configuration changes require a restart?
* Are there any manual housekeeping tasks that need to be performed on a
regular basis?
* Does old data need to be periodically archived?

== Structure

This section is usually fairly narrative in nature, with a heading for
each related set of information (e.g. monitoring, diagnostics,
configuration, etc).

== Motivation

Times change and team members move on, so recording this information can
help prevent those situations in the future where nobody understands how
to operate the software. It also helps to quickly answer basic questions
such as, "where are the log files?".

== Audience

The audience for this section is predominantly the technical people in
the software development team along with others that may help deploy,
support and operate the software system.

== Required

Yes, an operations and support section should be included in all
technical software documentation, unless you like throwing software into
a black hole and hoping for the best.
