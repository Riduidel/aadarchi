////
Although other sections of the documentation describe the overall
architecture of the software, often you'll want to present lower level
details to explain how things work. This is what the code section is
for. Some software architecture documentation templates call this the
"implementation view" or the "development view".

== Intent

The purpose of the code section is to describe the implementation
details for parts of the software system that are important, complex,
significant, etc. Examples include:

* Generating/rendering HTML: a short description of the framework that
was created for generating HTML, including the major classes and
concepts.
* Data binding: the approach to updating business objects as the result
of HTTP POST requests.
* Multi-page data collection: a short description of the framework used
for building forms that spanned multiple web pages.
* Web MVC: an example usage of the web MVC framework being used.
* Security: the approach to using Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) for
authentication and authorisation.
* Domain model: an overview of the important parts of the domain model.
* Component framework: a short description of the framework that we
built to allow components to be reconfigured at runtime.
* Configuration: a short description of the standard component
configuration mechanism in use across the codebase.
* Architectural layering: an overview of the layering strategy and the
patterns in use to implement it.
* Exceptions and logging: a summary of the approach to exception
handling and logging across the various architectural layers.
* Patterns and principles: an explanation of how patterns and
link:/help/documentation/principles[principles] are implemented.
* ...

== Structure

Keep it simple, with a short section for each element that you want to
describe and include diagrams if they help the reader. For example, a
high-level UML class and/or sequence diagram can be useful to help
explain how a bespoke/hand-written in-house framework works. Resist the
temptation to include all of the detail though, and don't feel that your
diagrams need to show everything. Instead, spend a few minutes sketching
out a high-level UML class diagram that shows selected (important)
attributes and methods rather than using the complex diagrams that can
be generated automatically from your codebase with UML tools or IDE
plugins. Keeping any diagrams at a high-level of detail means that
they're less volatile and remain up to date for longer because they can
tolerate small changes to the code and yet remain valid.

== Motivation

The motivation for writing this section is to ensure that everybody
understands how the important/significant/complex parts of the software
system work so that they can maintain, enhance and extend them in a
consistent and coherent manner. This section also helps new members of
the team get up to speed quickly.

== Audience

The audience for this section is predominantly the technical people in
the software development team.

=== Required

No, but there are usually parts of a large, non-trivial software system
that can benefit from some explanation.
