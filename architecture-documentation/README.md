This is a temporary README, that you **should** replace by a *good* one.

As an example, you could use [readme-md-generator](https://github.com/kefranabg/readme-md-generator)
by running the command `npx readme-md-generator`.

However, to build your application, just run `mvn install` and you'll be good to go.
If you want finer control/faster architect experience, you can also use [fizzed-watcher](https://github.com/fizzed/maven-plugins#watcher-fizzed-watcher-maven-plugin).
Typically, you can have documents updated live by running `mvn fizzed-watcher:run@watch-docs` 
and have slides updated live by running `mvn fizzed-watcher:run@watch-slides`.
