# Architecture documentation of agile architecture documentation system

This module is the best dogfooding example that can be, as we use agile architecture documentation system to document ... agile architecture documentation system.
As a consequence, the POM is rather big, mainly due to the required dependencies of Asciidoctor.

The signifiant parts are

* The java class `Architecture` (in `src/main/java` folder) which describes organization of this module
* The `src/docs/asciidoc` folder, which contains all files defined in agile architecture documentation to document this project.
