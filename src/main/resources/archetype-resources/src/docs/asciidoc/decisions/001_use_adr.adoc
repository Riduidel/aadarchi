# Use ADR to document architecture decisions

Date: 2020-01-14

## Decision

We will store decisions as asciidoc documents in `src/docs/asciidoc/decisions`.

## Status
**Accepted**

## Context

The purpose of this section is to simply record the major decisions that
have been made, including both the technology choices (e.g. products,
frameworks, etc) and the overall architecture (e.g. the structure of the
software, architectural style, decomposition, patterns, etc). For
example:

* Why did you choose technology or framework "X" over "Y" and "Z"?
* How did you do this? Product evaluation or proof of concept?
* Were you forced into making a decision about "X" based upon corporate
policy or enterprise architecture strategies?
* Why did you choose the selected software architecture? What other
options did you consider?
* How do you know that the solution satisfies the major quality
attributes?
* ...

## Alternatives

### Use decisions in Asciidoc

#### PROS
- Decisions will be integrated in generated documentation
- Rendering will be optimal

#### CONS
- Decisions will be burried deep inside Asciidoc hiearchy

### Use another format

#### PROS
- Decisions can be put in a specific folder
- We can use "tooling" to access those decisions

#### CONS
- Decisions will be isolate from architecture documentation
- Decision rendering will use another tooling (typically Markdown)

## Consequences
Integrating decisions in Asciidoc requires changing a section of architecture.
