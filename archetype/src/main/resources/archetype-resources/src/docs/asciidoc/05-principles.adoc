= Principles
:chapter: Principles

**TODO**
////
The principles section allows you to summarise those principles that
have been used (or you are using) to design and build the software.

== Intent

The purpose of this section is to simply make it explicit which
principles you are following. These could have been explicitly asked for
by a stakeholder or they could be principles that _you_ (i.e. the
software development team) want to adopt and follow.

== Structure

If you have an existing set of software development principles (e.g. on
a development wiki), by all means simply reference it. Otherwise, list
out the principles that you are following and accompany each with a
short explanation or link to further information. Example principles
include:

* Architectural layering strategy.
* No business logic in views.
* No database access in views.
* Use of interfaces.
* Always use an ORM.
* Dependency injection.
* The Hollywood principle (don't call us, we'll call you).
* High cohesion, low coupling.
* Follow
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)[SOLID]
(Single responsibility principle, Open/closed principle, Liskov
substitution principle, Interface segregation principle, Dependency
inversion principle).
* DRY (don't repeat yourself).
* Ensure all components are stateless (e.g. to ease scaling).
* Prefer a rich domain model.
* Prefer an anaemic domain model.
* Always prefer stored procedures.
* Never use stored procedures.
* Don't reinvent the wheel.
* Common approaches for error handling, logging, etc.
* Buy rather than build.
* ...

== Motivation

The motivation for writing down the list of principles is to make them
explicit so that everybody involved with the software development
understands what they are. Why? Put simply, principles help to introduce
consistency into a codebase by ensuring that common problems are
approached in the same way.

== Audience

The audience for this section is predominantly the technical people in
the software development team.

== Required

Yes, all technical software documentation should include a summary of
the principles that have been or are being used to develop the software.
