This is a temporary README, that you **should** replace by a *good* one.

As an example, you could use [readme-md-generator](https://github.com/kefranabg/readme-md-generator)
by running the command `npx readme-md-generator`.

However, to build your application, just run `mvn install` and you'll be good to go.
If you want finer control/faster architect experience, you can also use the provided livereload profile,
as stated in main documentation.
In other words, run `mvn -Pgenerate-docs -Plivereload` and go on [http://localhost:35729/docs/html/](http://localhost:35729/docs/html/). 
If your browser has a livereload extension, it'll automagically reload the documentation each time it is built.
