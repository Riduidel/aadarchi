    Care must be taken with slashes when specifying both the base URL and the relative URL as trailing and leading slashes have significant meaning. The following table illustrates the resolution of different types of URLs.

    <table class="graybox" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
        <tr><th>Base</th><th>Navigating To</th><th>Result</th></tr>
        <tr><td>http://myapp.com/</td><td>abc</td><td>http://myapp.com/abc</td></tr>
        <tr><td>http://myapp.com</td><td>abc</td><td>http://myapp.comabc</td></tr>
    </table>

    It is usually most desirable to define your base urls with trailing slashes and not to use leading slashes on relative URLs.
