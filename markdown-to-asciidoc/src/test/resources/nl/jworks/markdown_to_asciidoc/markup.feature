    The support provides:

    * Understanding of implicit browser methods (e.g. `to()`, `at()`) in test classes (e.g. `extends GebSpec`)
    * Understanding of content defined via the Content DSL (within `Page` and `Module` classes only)
    * Completion in `at {}` and `content {}` blocks

    This effectively enables more authoring support with less explicit type information. The Geb development team would like to thank the good folks at JetBrains for adding this explicit support for Geb to IDEA.
