This module is a fork of https://github.com/bodiam/markdown-to-asciidoc created to allow it to be used in entrerprisey contexts.

**Do not** contribute to this module, but rather to upstream project.

To retrieve code, run the command

> mvn generate-sources -pl :markdown-to-asciidoc -Pdownload

It will download source code (and README file), but won't manage dependencies, so you may have errors to fix.

IMPORTANT: WE DO NOT USE Kotlin here, so all kotlin code has been replaced by equivalent Java code. 
Why? 
Because the cost of foreign syntax doesn't pay when there is only one 18 KB file!
As a consequence, there is one error in `Converter.java` which can be fixed by simply replacing the Kotlin converter by the Java one.
